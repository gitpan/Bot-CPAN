=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basic bot system designed to make it easy to do simple bots, optionally
forking longer processes (like searches) concurrently in the background.

There are several examples of bots using Bot::CPAN::BasicBot in the examples/
folder in the Bot::CPAN::BasicBot tarball. If you installed Bot::CPAN::BasicBot through
CPAN, see http://jerakeen.org/programming/Bot-BasicBot for more docs and
examples.

A quick summary, though - You want to define your own package that
subclasses Bot::CPAN::BasicBot, override various methods (documented below),
then call new() and run() on it.

=cut

package Bot::CPAN::BasicBot;

require 5.008;

=head1 STARTING THE BOT

=head2 new( key => value, .. )

Creates a new instance of the class.  Name value pairs may be passed
which will have the same effect as calling the method of that name
with the value supplied. Returns a Bot::CPAN::BasicBot object, that you can
call 'run' on later.

eg:

  my $bot = Bot::CPAN::BasicBot->new( nick => 'superbot', channels => [ '#superheroes' ] );

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = bless {}, $class;

    $self->{IRCNAME} = 'wanna'.int(rand(100000));
    $self->{ALIASNAME} = 'pony'.int(rand(100000));

    # call the set methods
    my %args = @_;
    foreach my $method ( keys %args ) {
        if ( $self->can($method) ) {
            $self->$method( $args{$method} );
        } else {
            $self->{$method} = $args{$method};
            #croak "Invalid argument '$method'";
        }
    }

    $self->init or die "init did not return a true value - dying";

    return $self;
}

=head2 run()

Runs the bot.  Hands the control over to the POE core.

=cut

    my $self = shift;

=head1 METHODS TO OVERRIDE

In your Bot::CPAN::BasicBot subclass, you want to override some of the following
methods to define how your bot works. These are all object methods - the
(implicit) first parameter to all of them will be the bot object.

=head2 init()

called when the bot is created, as part of new(). Override to provide
your own init. Return a true value for a successful init, or undef if
you failed, in which case new() will die.

=cut

sub init { 1; }


=head2 said($args)

This is the main method that you'll want to override in your subclass -
it's the one called by default whenever someone says anything that we
can hear, either in a public channel or to us in private that we
shouldn't ignore.

You'll be passed a hashref that contains the arguments described below. 
Feel free to alter the values of this hash - it won't be used later on.

=over 4

=item who

Who said it (the nick that said it)

=item raw_nick

The raw IRC nick string of the person who said it. Only really useful
if you want more security for some reason.

=item channel

The channel in which they said it.  Has special value "msg" if it was in
a message.  Actually, you can send a message to many channels at once in
the IRC spec, but no-one actually does this so this is just the first
one in the list.

=item body

The body of the message (i.e. the actual text)

=item address

The text that indicates how we were addressed.  Contains the string
"msg" for private messages, otherwise contains the string off the text
that was stripped off the front of the message if we were addressed,
e.g. "Nick: ".  Obviously this can be simply checked for truth if you
just want to know if you were addressed or not.

=back

You should return what you want to say.  This can either be a simple
string (which will be sent back to whoever was talking to you as a
message or in public depending on how they were talking) or a hashref
that contains values that are compatible with say (just changing
the body and returning the structure you were passed works very well.)

Returning undef will cause nothing to be said.

=cut

sub said { undef }

=head2 emoted( $args )

This is a secondary method that you may wish to override. It gets called
when someone in channel 'emotes', instead of talking. In its default
configuration, it will simply pass anything emoted on channel through to
the C<said> handler.

C<emoted> receives the same data hash as C<said>.

=cut

sub emoted {
    shift->said(@_);
}

=head2 chanjoin( $mess )

Called when someone joins a channel. $mess is an object similar to a
said() message, $mess->{who} is the nick of the user who joined,
$mess->{channel} is the channel they joined.

This is a do-nothing implementation, override this in your subclass.

=cut

sub chanjoin { undef }

=head2 chanpart( $mess )

Called when someone leaves a channel. $mess is an object similar to a
said() message, $mess->{who} is the nick of the user who left,
$mess->{channel} is the channel they left.

This is a do-nothing implementation, override this in your subclass.

=cut

sub chanpart { undef }

=head2 got_names( $mess )

Whenever we have been given a definitive list of 'who is in the channel',
this function will be called. As usual, $mess is a hash. $mess->{channel}
will be the channel we have information for, $mess->{names} is a hashref,
where the keys are the nicks of the users, and the values are more hashes,
containing the two keys 'op' and 'voice', indicating if the user is a chanop
or voiced respectively.

The reply value is ignored.

Normally, I wouldn't override this method - instead, just use the L<names>
call when you want to know who's in the channel. Override this only if you
want to be able to do something as soon as possible. Also be aware that
the names list can be changed by other events - kicks, joins, etc, and this
method won't be called when that happens.

=cut

sub got_names { undef }

=head2 topic( $mess )

Called when the topic of the channel changes. $mess->{channel} is the channel
the topic was set in, $mess->{who} is the nick of the user who changed the
channel, and $mess->{topic} will be the new topic of the channel.

=cut

sub topic { undef }

=head2 nick_change( $mess )

When a user changes nicks, this will be called. $mess looks like

  { from => "old_nick",
    to => "new_nick",
  }

=cut

sub nick_change { undef }

=head2 kicked( $mess )

Called when a user is kicked from the channel. $mess looks like:

  { channel => "#channel",
    who => "nick",
    kicked => "kicked",
    reason => "reason",
  }

The reply value is ignored.

=cut

sub kicked { undef }

=head2 tick()

This is an event called every regularly. The function should return the
amount of time until the tick event should next be called. The default
tick is called 5 seconds after the bot starts, and the default
implementation returns '0', which disables the tick. Override this and
return non-zero values to have an ongoing tick event.

Use this function if you want the bot to do something periodically, and
don't want to mess with 'real' POE things.

Call the L<schedule_tick> event to schedule a tick event without waiting
for the next tick.

=cut


sub tick { return 0; }


=head2 help

This is the other method that you should override.  This is the text
that the bot will respond to if someone simply says help to it.  This
should be considered a special case which you should not attempt to
process yourself.  Saying help to a bot should have no side effects
whatsoever apart from returning this text.

=cut

sub help { "Sorry, this bot has no interactive help." }

=head2 connected

An optional method to override, gets called after we have connected
to the server

=cut

sub connected { undef }



=head1 BOT METHODS

There are a few methods you can call on the bot object to do things. These
are as follows:

=head2 schedule_tick(time)

Causes the L<tick> event to be called in 'time' seconds (or 5 seconds if
time is left unspecified). Note that if the tick event is due to be
called already, this will override it, you can't schedule multiple
future events with this funtction.

=cut

sub schedule_tick {
  my $self = shift;
  my $time = shift || 5;
  $self->{kernel}->delay( tick => $time );
}

=head2 forkit

This method allows you to fork arbitrary background processes. They
will run concurrently with the main bot, returning their output to a
handler routine. You should call C<forkit> in response to specific
events in your C<said> routine, particularly for longer running
processes like searches, which will block the bot from receiving or
sending on channel whilst they take place if you don't fork them.

C<forkit> takes the following arguments:

=over 4

=item run

A coderef to the routine which you want to run. Bear in mind that the
routine doesn't automatically get the text of the query - you'll need
to pass it in C<arguments> (see below) if you want to use it at all.

Apart from that, your C<run> routine just needs to print its output to
C<STDOUT>, and it will be passed on to your designated handler.

=item handler

Optional. A method name within your current package which we can
return the routine's data to. Defaults to the built-in method
C<say_fork_return> (which simply sends data to channel).

=item body

Optional. Use this to pass on the body of the incoming message that
triggered you to fork this process. Useful for interactive proceses
such as searches, so that you can act on specific terms in the user's
instructions.

=item who

The nick of who you want any response to reach (optional inside a
channel.)

=item channel

Where you want to say it to them in.  This may be the special channel
"msg" if you want to speak to them directly

=item address

Optional.  Setting this to a true value causes the person to be
addressed (i.e. to have "Nick: " prepended to the front of returned
message text if the response is going to a public forum.

=item arguments

Optional. This should be an anonymous array of values, which will be
passed to your C<run> routine. Bear in mind that this is not
intelligent - it will blindly spew arguments at C<run> in the order
that you specify them, and it is the responsibility of your C<run>
routine to pick them up and make sense of them.

=back

=cut

sub forkit {
    my $self = shift;
    my $args;
    if (ref($_[0])) {
        $args = shift;
    } else {

        StderrFilter => POE::Filter::Line->new(),
        StdoutEvent  => "$args->{handler}",
        StderrEvent  => "fork_error",
        CloseEvent   => "fork_close"
    );

    # store the wheel object in our bot, so we can retrieve/delete easily

    $self->{forks}->{ $wheel->ID } = {

    my $args = $self->{forks}->{$wheel_id}->{args};
    $args->{body} = $body;

    $self->say($args);
}

=head2 say( key => value, .. )

Say something to someone.  You should pass the following arguments:

=over 4

=item who

The nick of who you are saying this to (optional inside a channel.)

=item channel

Where you want to say it to them in.  This may be the special channel
"msg" if you want to speak to them directly

=item body

The body of the message.  I.e. what you want to say.

=item address

Optional.  Setting this to a true value causes the person to be
addressed (i.e. to have "Nick: " prepended to the front of the message
text if this message is going to a pulbic forum.

=back

You can also make non-OO calls to C<say>, which will be interpreted as
coming from a process spawned by C<forkit>. The routine will serialise
any data it is sent, and throw it to STDOUT, where L<POE::Wheel::Run> can
pass it on to a handler.

=cut

sub say {

    # If we're called without an object ref, then we're handling saying
    # stuff from inside a forked subroutine, so we'll freeze it, and toss
    # it out on STDOUT so that POE::Wheel::Run's handler can pick it up.
    if ( !ref( $_[0] ) ) {
        print $_[0] . "\n";
        return 1;
    }

    # Otherwise, this is a standard object method

        $poe_kernel->post( $self->{IRCNAME}, 'privmsg', $who, $body );
    }
}

=head2 emote( key => value, .. )

C<emote> will return data to channel, but emoted (as if you'd said "/me
writes a spiffy new bot" in most clients). It takes the same arguments
as C<say>, listed above.

=cut

sub emote {

    # If we're called without an object ref, then we're handling emoting
    # stuff from inside a forked subroutine, so we'll freeze it, and

    $poe_kernel->post( $self->{IRCNAME}, 'privmsg', $self->charset_encode($who, "\cAACTION " . $body . "\cA") );
}

=head2 reply($mess, $body)

Reply to a message $mess. Will reply to an incoming message
with the text '$body', in a privmsg if $mess was a privmsg, in channel if
not, and prefixes if $mess was prefixed. Mostly a shortcut method - it's
roughly equivalent to $mess->{body} = $body; $self->say($mess);

=cut

sub reply {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($mess, $body) = @_;
    my %hash = %$mess;

}



=head2 channel_data

=cut

sub channel_data {
  my $self = shift;
  my $channel = shift or return;
  return $self->{channel_data}{$channel}
}

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Get or set methods.  Changing most of these values when connected
won't cause sideffects.  e.g. changing the server will not
cause a disconnect and a reconnect to another server.

Attributes that accept multiple values always return lists and
either accept an arrayref or a complete list as an argument.

The usual way of calling these is as keys to the hash passed to the
'new' method.

=head2 server

The server we're going to connect to.  Defaults to
"irc.perl.org".

=cut

sub servers {
    my $self = shift;
    if (@_) {
        my @args = (ref $_[0] eq "ARRAY") ? @{$_[0]} : @_;
        $self->{servers} = \@args;
    }
    @{$self->{servers} || ["irc.perl.org"]}
}

=head2 port

The port we're going to use.  Defaults to "6667"

=cut

sub port {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{port} = shift if @_;
    return $self->{port} || "6667";
}

=head2 password

The server password for the server we're going to connect to.  Defaults to
undef.

=cut

sub password {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{password} = shift if @_;
    return $self->{password} || undef;
}

=head2 ssl

A boolean to indicate whether or not the server we're going to connect to
is an SSL server.  Defaults to 0.

=cut

sub ssl {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{ssl} = shift if @_;
    return $self->{ssl} || 0;
}

=head2 nick

The nick we're going to use.  Defaults to five random letters
and numbers followed by the word "bot"

=cut

sub nick {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{nick} = shift if @_;
    return $self->{nick} ||= _random_nick();
}

sub _random_nick {
    my @things = ( 'a' .. 'z' );
    return join '', ( map { @things[ rand @things ] } 0 .. 4 ), "bot";
}

=head2 alt_nicks

Alternate nicks that this bot will be known by.  These are not nicks
that the bot will try if it's main nick is taken, but rather other
nicks that the bot will recognise if it is addressed in a public
channel as the nick.  This is useful for bots that are replacements
for other bots...e.g, your bot can answer to the name "infobot: "
even though it isn't really.

=cut

sub alt_nicks {
    my $self = shift;
    if (@_) {

        # make sure we copy
        my @args = ( ref $_[0] eq "ARRAY" ) ? @{ $_[0] } : @_;
        $self->{alt_nicks} = \@args;
    }
    @{ $self->{alt_nicks} || [] };
}

=head2 username

The username we'll claim to have at our ip/domain.  By default this
will be the same as our nick.

=cut

sub username {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{username} = shift if @_;
    $self->{username} or $self->nick;
}

=head2 name

The name that the bot will identify itself as.  Defaults to
"$nick bot" where $nick is the nick that the bot uses.

=cut

sub name {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{name} = shift if @_;
    $_[0]->{name} or $self->nick . " bot";
}

=head2 channels

The channels we're going to connect to.

=cut

sub channels {
    my $self = shift;
    if (@_) {

        # make sure we copy
        my @args = ( ref $_[0] eq "ARRAY" ) ? @{ $_[0] } : @_;
        $self->{channels} = \@args;
    }
    @{ $self->{channels} || [] };
}

=head2 quit_message

The quit message.  Defaults to "Bye".

=cut

sub quit_message {

=head2 ignore_list

The list of irc nicks to ignore B<public> messages from (normally
other bots.)  Useful for stopping bot cascades.

=head2 charset

IRC has no defined character set for putting high-bit chars into channel.
In general, people tend to assume latin-1, but in case your channel thinks
differently, the bot can be told about different charsets.

This feature requires perl 5.8+, I'm not fannying about with charsets
under any other version of perl.

=cut

=head1 STATES

These are the POE states that we register in order to listen for IRC
events. For the most part you don't need to worry about these, unless
you want to override them to do something clever.

=head2 start_state

Called when we start.  Used to fire a "connect to irc server event"

=cut

sub start_state {
    my ( $self, $kernel, $session ) = @_[ OBJECT, KERNEL, SESSION ];
    $self->{kernel} = $kernel;
    $self->{session} = $session;

    # Make an alias for our session, to keep it from getting GC'ed.
    $kernel->alias_set($self->{ALIASNAME});

    $kernel->delay('reconnect', 1 );

    $kernel->delay('tick', 30);
}

=head2 reconnect

Connects the bot to the IRC server. Called 1 second after the 'start'
event.

in an ideal world, this will never get called again - we schedule it for 'x'
seconds in the future, and whenever we see a server ping we reset this
counter again. This means that it'll get run if we haven't seen anything
from the server for a while, so we can assume that something bad has
happened. At that point we shotgun the IRC session and restart
everything, so we reconnect to the server.

This is by far the most reliable way I have found of ensuring that a bot
will reconnect to a server after it's lost a network connection for some
reason.

By default, the timeout is 300 seconds. It can be set by changing
$Bot::CPAN::BasicBot::RECONNECT_TIMEOUT.

=head2 irc_001_state

Called when we connect to the irc server.  This is used to tell

=head2 irc_kicked_state

Called on kick.  If we're kicked then it's best to do
nothing.  Bots are normally called in wrapper that restarts them
if we die, which may end us up in a busy loop.  Anyway, if we're not
wanted, the best thing to do would be to hang around off channel.

=head2 irc_ping_state

The most reliable way I've found of doing auto-server-rejoin is to listen for
pings. Every ping we get, we put off rejoining the server for another few mins.
If we haven't heard a ping in a while, the rejoin code will get called.

Recently, I've adapted this for servers that don't send pings very often,
and reset the counter any time _anything_ interesting happens.

You can change the amount of time the bot waits between events before calling
a reconnect event by changing $Bot::CPAN::BasicBot::RECONNECT_TIMEOUT to a value in
seconds. The default is '500'.

=head1 CREDITS

The initial version of Bot::CPAN::BasicBot was written by Mark Fowler,
and many thanks are due to him.

Nice code for dealing with emotes thanks to Jo Walsh.

Various patches from Tom Insam, including much improved rejoining,
AUTOLOAD stuff, better interactive help, and a few API tidies.

Maintainership for a while was in the hands of Simon Kent
E<lt>simon@hitherto.netE<gt>. Don't know what he did. :-)

I recieved patches for tracking joins and parts from Silver, sat on
them for two months, and have finally applied them. Thanks, dude. He also
sent me changes for the tick event API, which made sense.

=head1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Bot::CPAN::BasicBot is based on POE, and really needs the latest version as
of writing (0.22), since POE::Wheel::Run (used for forking) is still
under development, and the interface recently changed. With earlier
versions of POE, forking will not work, and the makefile process will
carp if you have < 0.22. Sorry.

You also need POE::Component::IRC.

=head1 BUGS

During the make, make test make install process, POE will moan about
its kernel not being run. I'll try and gag it in future releases, but
hey, release early, release often, and it's not a fatal error. It just
looks untidy.

Don't call your bot "0".

Nick tracking blatantly doesn't work yet. In Progress.

C<fork_error_state> handlers sometimes seem to cause the bot to
segfault. I'm not yet sure if this is a POE::Wheel::Run problem, or a
problem in our implementation.
