Revision history for Perl extension Bot::CPAN.

0.01_07-pre  Sat Mar 22 23:31:47 2003
         - ** Since there has been an API modification and pervasive changes
           made to this release it is marked as a pre-developer release. It
           requires wide testing before being promoted to _07. Despite my
           thorough personal testing, _07-pre should be considered unstable
           until it reaches _07. Please report any anomalies directly to
           afoxson@pobox.com, as early as possible.  Thank you. **
         - API CHANGE: the 'server' constructor option has been changed to
           'servers', and now requires an arrayref or a list. One of these
           servers will be picked randomly, everytime the bot needs to connect
           or reconnect
         - author is now case insensitive for all author-based commands
         - improved POD
         - fixed a little documentation bug; the policy example should have
           used qr instead of qw
         - _check_policy no longer /i's all regexes; this should be
           specifically specified with the qr// defined in the policy
         - Spoon@#cpan@magnet suggested that commands that take a module for
           an argument should autocorrect mis-casing; this would mean that
           someone wanting to, say, get the version of Test::Reporter, could
           instead specify test::reporter and get an actual version instead of
           a 'No such module' error message. This feature has been added. It
           will always first check if there is an exact match, and only then
           attempt a fuzzy match. If no match, of any type can be made, then
           it errors out. This works on all commands that accept a module
           argument
         - fixed a teeny little memory leak with the 'readme' feature; the leak
           caused a loss of length-of-nick + 7 bytes per unique person that
           requested a readme
         - added 'dlurl' command - retrieves the download url of a module
         - added 'adminhost' to the constructor - specifies a regular
           expression that will be matched against userhosts for commands that
           require administrative access
         - added the :Admin attribute, which marks a command to be executable
           by an admin only
         - internal improvements to CPAN.pm; abstracted out _check_author
           and _check_module
         - added more tests
         - Bot::CPAN will now reconnect if it loses the server connection
         - Bot::CPAN will now display an informative message if someone
           attempts to get info on a brand new distribution, that we don't
           yet have indice data for
         - admin command 'config' added - shows the bots configuration details

         - improved error handling of NNTP functions
         - comprehensive NNTP logging has been added
         - a significant bug with NNTP processing has been fixed; this would
           cause channel 'cpan upload' informs to take systematically longer
           to actually post
         - Bot::BasicBot has been patched too extensively to maintain it as a
           dependency, not to mention the further patching it needs, therefore
           it has been bundled, and will eventually be further integrated, and
           perhaps rewritten
         - logging format further improved; entries are now timestamped,
           communications to the bot are wrapped in => <='s, and we no longer
           log channel chatter, unless we were specifically addressed or if
           debugging is enabled
         - fixed several bugs that would generate uninitialized value errors
         - fixed a minor issue with _get_details in which it was not reporting
           that a module was invalid
         - doubled the number of tests
         - made further improvements to the POD
         - added 'debug' option to the constructor. if this is enabled you will
           get *extremely* verbose debugging output
         - added 'policy' option to the constructor (see POD)
         - added 'search_max_results' to the constructor
         - added 'rt' command - gets url of a dist's request tracker page
         - added 'whois' command - gets a name/email from a CPAN ID
         - added 'search' command - returns modules that match a regex
         - added 'readme' command - returns README for a module via DCC CHAT

         - new patches for both POE::Component::IRC, and Bot::BasicBot are
           included. you'll need to reinstall both distributions from scratch,
           and re-patch both with the new patches
         - if the patches are not correctly installed the bot will refuse
           to run
         - fixed another issue with Bot::BasicBot, this time with addressing
         - improvements to the POD
         - author is now case insensitive for modules and distributions
         - Bot::CPAN is now attributed in 'help'
         - fixed issue where ignore_list wasn't being respected
         - the logging format has been dramatically improved
         - _reload_indices is now forked off so it doesn't block the bot
         - added some real tests, but need much more
         - special thanks to Spoon@#cpan@magnet for pointing out some of the
           anomalies that are fixed in this version, and for beta testing

0.01_04  Wed Mar 12 18:35:41 2003
         - bug fix for 'help'
         - all incoming commands are now case insensitive

0.01_03  Wed Mar 12 02:51:23 2003
         - generated new Bot::BasicBot patch; fixes more issues
         - pervase improvements to the internal architecture;
           deep magic can be found in Glue.pm, which may eventually
           be spun off as an independant bot development framework
         - help system fully implemented
         - we now uses notices instead of privmsg's to return data
         - 'recent' command added
         - we now support fully integrated attribute handlers
         - more information has been added to the POD and README
         - many thanks to gilc@#perl@magnet for beta testing
