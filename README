NAME
    Bot::CPAN - provides CPAN services via IRC

SYNOPSIS
      use Bot::CPAN;

      my $bot = Bot::CPAN->new(
          channels => ['#cpan'],
          server => 'grou.ch',
          port => 6667,
          nick => 'cpantest',
          alt_nicks => ['cpantest2', 'cpantest3'],
          username => 'cpantest',
          name => 'cpantest',
          ignore_list => [qw(purl)],
      );
      $bot->run();

DESCRIPTION
    This is the initial developer release of Bot::CPAN. You should not
    expect that the API will remain stable, as this is currently a work in
    progress.

    Bot::CPAN allows individuals on IRC to query the CPAN in a great number
    of different ways. Bot::CPAN will also automatically inform the channel
    of new uploads to the CPAN.

METHODS
    * new
        This constructor returns a Bot::CPAN object, and is inherited from
        Bot::BasicBot. It will optionally accept named parameters for:
        channels, server, port, nick, alt_nicks, username, name,
        ignore_list, store, and log.

    * run
        Fires the bot up.

CAVEATS
        At the moment you'll need to patch BasicBot.pm if you expect
        Bot::CPAN to operate normally. The patch simply corrects a minor
        error in BasicBot.pm.

        Additionally, you'll also need to patch POE::Component::IRC in order
        to get the prioritized messaging (which is needed to prevent
        blocking during sending back lots of data to users).

        The patches have been sent to the upstream authors. The patches can
        be found in etc/.

BUGS

        Thank you.

TODO
          - write actual tests
          - add support for recent, fetch and readme
          - improve help system support
          - perhaps use notices instead of msgs when returning data

AUTHOR
        Adam J. Foxson <afoxson@pobox.com>, with patches from Casey West
        <cwest@cpan.org> to support the latest POE versions, and a patch
        from Randal Schwartz <merlyn@stonehenge.com> to support NNTP
        retrieval of CPAN uploads (as opposed to the old way of doing it via
        mailbox polling).
